    "general_definition": "Sustainable agriculture focuses on producing food, fiber, and other plant and animal products using farming techniques that protect the environment, public health, human communities, and animal welfare.",
    "general_points": {
      "Impact of Regenerative Practices": "Regenerative agriculture practices like cover cropping, crop rotation, and agroforestry are gaining momentum globally, with scientific evidence showing these methods improve biodiversity, soil quality, water quality, and pest control. These practices also contribute to carbon sequestration, mitigating climate change effects.",
      "Role of Precision Farming": "Artificial intelligence and precision farming technologies are increasingly driving sustainable agriculture, enabling data-driven decisions that optimize resource use and increase productivity while reducing environmental impact. These technologies help farmers monitor crop health, apply nutrients precisely, and save resources.",
      "Importance of Crop Diversity": "Crop diversity through rotation can increase the biodiversity of plants and animals, enhancing natural pest control and boosting ecosystem health on farms. Practices like precision farming and soilless farming systems are also helping farmers adapt to climate change by allowing better crop resilience and controlled environments."
