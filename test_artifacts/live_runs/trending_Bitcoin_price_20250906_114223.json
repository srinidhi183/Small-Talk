  "description": "Bitcoin experienced a notable price correction in September 2025, with its value dropping about 6.5% to just above $108,000 after reaching all-time highs above $120,000. This correction conforms to historical seasonal patterns of weakness in September but is also accompanied by significant institutional accumulation and technical indicators suggesting potential for a strong rebound later in the year.",

    "Despite the price dip, whale addresses holding 100+ BTC have reached record highs, signaling strong institutional confidence amid retail uncertainty.",
    "Indicators such as bullish RSI divergences and key support levels between $105,000 and $110,000 suggest a possible upward rally, making Bitcoin price movements a focus for investors and analysts right now."
