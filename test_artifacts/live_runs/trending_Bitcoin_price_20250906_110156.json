  "key_points": [
    "Bitcoin opened September 2025 around $108,253 after peaking near $124,533 in August, with forecasts fluctuating between roughly $112,000 and $126,000 through the next months.",
    "Critical support zones are between $105,000 to $110,000, with $100,000 considered a psychological and technical benchmark; resistance is near $110,000.",
    "Analysts project potential recoveries to $125,000â€“$280,000 by year-end if favorable conditions like Fed rate cuts and dollar weakness occur, but caution is advised due to risk of extended correction."

  "overlook_what_might_happen_next": [
    "Historically, September sell-offs have preceded strong Q4 rallies, suggesting a possible rebound after this correction phase.",
    "If Bitcoin falls below $105,000 support, it could accelerate losses down to $95,000 or even as low as $78,000 in extreme scenarios, especially if macroeconomic or regulatory factors worsen.",
    "The current correction might offer buying opportunities for long-term investors, but short-term bearish momentum and technical signals suggest caution before committing large positions."
