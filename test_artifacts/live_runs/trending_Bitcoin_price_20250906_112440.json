    "Analysts anticipate Bitcoin to fluctuate between support levels near $100,000–$110,000 in the short term, with forecasts projecting a potential rebound to $125,000–$280,000 by year-end if macroeconomic conditions like Fed rate cuts and a weakening US dollar materialize.",
    "Bitcoin's short-term RSI is below 30, indicating strong bearish momentum and possible overselling, signaling a likely short-term drop ahead before any potential recovery.",
    "Technical analysis warns of risk for deeper corrections targeting $78,000–$95,000 levels if key supports fail, with a notable head-and-shoulders pattern possibly triggering a 20–30% price drop that most analysts view as a healthy market correction."

  "overlook_what_might_happen_next": [
    "History suggests that September corrections often precede strong Q4 rallies, implying that Bitcoin could rebound significantly if economic factors remain favorable and institutional buying continues.",
    "Close attention is needed on $93,000–$95,000 and $100,000 psychological support levels; breaching these could extend the correction phase, while holding them may stabilize prices.",
    "Federal Reserve policy decisions and US dollar strength will heavily influence Bitcoin's trajectory, with expectations that rate cuts and dollar weakness could be bullish triggers for price recovery."
